Project Description:
Telco is experiencing a large amount of customer churn. Why are customers churning and are there ways we can decrease it?

Goals:
Find drivers for customer churn at Telco. Why are customers churning?
Construct a ML classification model that accurately predicts customer churn.
Deliver a report that a non-data scientist can read through and understand what steps were taken, why and what was the outcome?

Initial Questions:
1) Do customers churn after they've spent a certain amount of money with the company?
2) Do customers with a partner and dependents churn at a different rate?
3) What month are customers most likely to churn?
4) Do customers with more addons churn at a different rate?

Data Dictionary:

Project Planning:
