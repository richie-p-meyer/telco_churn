Project Description:
Telco is experiencing a large amount of customer churn. Why are customers churning and are there ways we can decrease it?

Goals:
Find drivers for customer churn at Telco. Why are customers churning?
Construct a ML classification model that accurately predicts customer churn.
Deliver a report that a non-data scientist can read through and understand what steps were taken, why and what was the outcome?

Initial Questions:
1) Do customers churn after they've spent a certain amount of money with the company?
2) Do customers with a partner and dependents churn at a different rate?
3) What month are customers most likely to churn?
4) Do customers with more addons churn at a different rate?

Data Dictionary:

Project Planning:
1) Determine which columns I need and which I can drop. 
2) Add column with an 'addon' count
3) Answer questions one at a time
    a) Do customers with higher monthly_charges churn at a different rate?
        viz
        stat test
    b) Do customers with a partner or dependents churn at a different rate?
        viz
        stat test

    c) What month are customers most likely to churn?
        viz
        stat test
    d) Do customers with more addons churn at a different rate?
        viz
        stat test
4) Add Ho and Ha
5) Pick and run 3 classification methods
6) Make predictions on full data set, save as csv
7) Comment all code, add markdown cells
